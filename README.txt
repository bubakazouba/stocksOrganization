At the very minimum our project should allow the user to
do the following:
	1.add new data
	2.delete data
	3.find and display one data record using primary key
	4.list data in hash table sequence
	5.list data in key sequence(sorted)
	6.print indented tree
	7.hash statisitics
	8. quit


Start coding you monkeys!
